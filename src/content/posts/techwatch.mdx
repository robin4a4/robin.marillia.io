Techwatch was a little bookmark app created in Sveltekit. I had multiple categories and could upload links with a little description.
It was super useful to condense in one place ressources from twitter or tech influencer's blogs. Because the planetscale went to sleep, I decided to deprecate the project and create a much more powerfull app, [shareboard.io](/projects/shareboard).

## The project

I wanted to use Svelte and the recent SvelteKit full stack framework that was in beta at the time. I really wanted to make a production app using this framework and also planetscale that I discoverd at this time.
