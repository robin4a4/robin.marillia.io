At the beginning of 2023, I became really interested in compilers and parsers. I also wanted to build a site with the minimum of javascript and libraries but wanted the modularity of templating languages instead of one big HTML file.

I decided to start to create a small compiler that would parse a few custom HTML tags. I created a package called `compile-include-html` that would parse `<include>` and `<for>` tags.

```html
<!-- main.html -->

<div class="container">
  <include src="card.html" with="text: hello world" />
</div>
```

```html
<!-- card.html -->

<div class="card">{text}</div>
```

```html
<!-- main.html after compilation -->

<div class="container">
  <div class="card">hello world</div>
</div>
```

## The process

All my previous projects where user facing experiments where I could run `npm run dev` in local and it would launch a server with hot reloading. This time, it was a package for other devs to use so I had to:

- learn how to develop a package in dev: how to test the changes in local
- learn how to publish a package on npm

### Development

For this project I used test driven development. It was the first time that I used it and I really liked it. Before adding a feature, I just had to add a failing test and then make it pass.

I used [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as a testing framework.

Because the package searches for files in different folders I also created some real examples to test that the imports where working correctly in a more real world environment.

### Publishing

To publish my package I automated the process using [Changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and github actions.

Every time I run `pnpm run release`, It builds the code, creates a new release in the changelog and publishes the package on npm if the CI passed. All that in 30 lines of code thanks to Changeset.

## The package

### Installation

```
npm i compile-include-html
```

### Simple for loop example

```typescript
// javascript file where the context is defined
import { HtmlParser } from "compile-include-html";
const source = `
<div class="container">
    <for condition="const user of array">
        <span>Firstname: {user.firstName}, lastname: {user.lastName}</span>
    </for>
</div>`;

const context = {
  array: [
    { firstName: "john", lastName: "doe" },
    { firstName: "jannet", lastName: "foe" },
  ],
};
const htmlParser = new HtmlParser({
  globalContext: context,
});
const output = htmlParser.transform(source);
```

```html
<!-- output -->
<div class="container">
  <span>Firstname: john, lastname: doe</span>
  <span>Firstname: jannet, lastname: foe</span>
</div>
```

### Context replacement

```typescript
// javascript file where the context is defined
import { HtmlParser } from "compile-include-html";
const source = `<a href="{link.href}">{link.name}</a>`;

const parser = new HtmlParser({
  globalContext: {
    link: {
      href: "https://example.com",
      name: "link to example",
    },
  },
});
const output = htmlParser.transform(source);
```

```html
<!-- output -->
<a href="https://example.com">link to example</a>
```

### Usage

Create a new HtmlParser with:

```typescript
import { HtmlParser } from "compile-include-html";
const htmlParser = new HtmlParser();
```

#### Options

You can pass an option object to your parser.

```typescript
type options = {
  indent?: number;
  inputIsDocument?: boolean;
  globalContext?: TContext;
  basePath?: string;
};
```

- `indent`: You can set the indentation of your generated html with the `indent` property.
- `inputIsDocument`: determines whether the input is an entire document with `<DOCTYPE>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags or just a fragment. It will allow the parser to correctly manage both cases.
- `globalContext`: allows you to pass a context object to the parser. It will be used to replace values wrapped in `{` and `}`. Brackets values only work on attributes values and text nodes, for example:

```html
<!-- will work -->
<p class="{className}">{paragraph}</p>

<!-- will not work -->
<p {classAttr}="px-4">{paragraph}</p>
```

- `basePath`: allows you to pass a basePath to your parser, for example you can do

```typescript
import { HtmlParser } from "compile-include-html";
const htmlParser = new HtmlParser({ basePath: "pages/about" });
```

```html
<!-- main.html -->

<div class="container">
  <include src="card.html" with="text: hello world" />
</div>
```

instead of

```html
<!-- main.html -->

<div class="container">
  <include src="pages/about/card.html" with="text: hello world" />
</div>
```

#### Methods

##### `readFile(path: string): string`

Use it to read a file and retrieve a string of the file's content.

##### `transform(source: string): string`

Use it to transform a string using the include or for tag into its compiled version.

##### `outputNewFile(inputPath: string, outputPath: string): void`

Use it to compile an input file located at `inputPath` and create an output file located at `outputPath`.
