I created this website for Nathalie Mura, a French painter based in Vannes. The website is built with **Nextjs and Strapi CMS**.

See the paintings at [nathalie-mura.com](https://nathalie-mura.com)

## The project

Nathalie Mura wanted a website to showcase her paintings and to be able to update it herself. The paintings had to be organized by categories that should also be editable using the CMS.

My first ever production website was the old version of this site, made in 2014 in **PHP and jQuery**, so I was very happy to be able to refactor it using more modern technologies. Indeed I had re-created myself a little CMS for the old version, but it was very basic and very buggy.

## The stack

I chose **Nextjs** for the frontend because I wanted to try it out and I thought it would be a good fit for this project. I used **Tailwind CSS** for the styling. I mainly chose the Strapi CMS because a friend of mine used it in production and was happy with it but i know there are a lot of other promising modern CMSs.

I did not use typescript as I was not confortable enough with it at the time but it should be easy to port it to typescript in the future given the small size of the project.

## Hosting

The website is hosted on **Vercel** and the CMS is hosted on **Heroku**.
I chose Heroku because it was free (at the time) and easy to set up. Now that Heroku is not free anymore, I'd like to try to migrate to [Render](https://render.com) that offers a free tier for small projects.
I also use **Cloudinary** to host the images.
