[Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com) is a modern javascript framework that has a new approch on reactivity and dom rendering. I love it because its syntax is close to react which I know well but its reactivity system seems much more intuitive and simpler. For exemple there is no dependency arrays and no "too many re-renders".

I wanted to contribute a little so I chose to redesign the next iteration of their docs.

## Figma design and prototypes

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

<button onclick="alert('clicked!')">Embedded component in MDX</button>

- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.
