[Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com) is a modern javascript framework that has a new approch on reactivity and dom rendering. I love it because its syntax is close to react which I know well but its reactivity system seems much more intuitive and simpler. For exemple there is no dependency arrays and no "too many re-renders".

I wanted to contribute a little so I chose to redesign the next iteration of their docs.
