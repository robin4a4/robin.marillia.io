After experimenting with creating my own framework, I wanted to use the newest app router using React server components (RFC's) in a brand new project where I could use bleeding edge tech and to notch libraries.

Because my Techwatch database went to sleep and because I wanted to be able to store more that links and better manage my categories, I decided to create a new app called Shareboard.

## What is Shareboard?

A white canvas with drabble notes, images and files. You can create as many boards as you want and share them with anyone using a shareable link. The authentication is done using Clerk and the data is stored in PlanetScale.
